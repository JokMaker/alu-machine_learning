# Advanced Linear Algebra

This directory contains implementations of advanced linear algebra operations in Python.

## Files

- `0-determinant.py`: Calculate the determinant of a matrix
- `1-minor.py`: Calculate the minor matrix of a matrix
- `2-cofactor.py`: Calculate the cofactor matrix of a matrix
- `3-adjugate.py`: Calculate the adjugate matrix of a matrix
- `4-inverse.py`: Calculate the inverse of a matrix
- `5-definiteness.py`: Determine the definiteness of a matrix

## Requirements

- Python 3.5
- NumPy 1.15 (for definiteness function only)
- All files follow pycodestyle (version 2.5)
